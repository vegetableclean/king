## Setup
Install anaconda
```Shell
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
source ~/.profile
```

Clone the repo and build the environment

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/autonomousvision/king
cd king
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate king
```

Download and setup CARLA 0.9.10.1
```Shell
chmod +x setup_carla.sh
./setup_carla.sh
```

## Running the code
We provide bash scripts for the experiments for convenience. Please make sure the "CARLA_ROOT" ("./carla_server" by default) and "KING_ROOT" (if present) environment variables are set correctly in all of those scripts.

### KING Scenario Generation
For all of the generation scripts, first spin up a carla server in a separate shell:
```Shell
carla_server/CarlaUE4.sh --world-port=2000 -opengl
```
Then run the following script for AIM-BEV generation:
```Shell
bash run_generation.sh
```
This script runs generation for all traffic density and automatically evaluates the results.
For AIM-BEV generation using both gradient paths, run:
```Shell
bash run_generation_both_paths.sh
```
Finally, to generate scenarios for [TransFuser](https://github.com/autonomousvision/transfuser), first download the model weights:
```Shell
mkdir driving_agents/king/transfuser/model_checkpoints/regular
cd driving_agents/king/transfuser/model_checkpoints/regular
wget https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/avg-projects/transfuser/models.zip
unzip models.zip
rm -rf models.zip late_fusion geometric_fusion cilrs aim
```
Then change back to root directory of the repository and run:
```Shell
bash run_generation_transfuser.sh
```

### Fine-tuning
To fine-tune the original agent on KING scenarios, first download the regular data for AIM-BEV:
```
chmod +x download_regular_data.sh
./download_regular_data.sh
```
Then run the fine-tuning script (and adjust it for the correct dataset path, if necessary):
```
bash run_fine_tuning.sh
```
This script also automatically runs evaluation on KING scenarios.

### Town10 Intersections 
To evaluate the original checkpoint for AIM-BEV on the Town10 intersections benchmark, spin up a carla server and run
```Shell
leaderboard/scripts/run_evaluation.sh
```
To evaluate a fine-tuned model, run the fine-tuning script above and toggle the commented "TEAM_CONFIG" variable in the evaluation script to change the model weights.
